#### Link to the deployed project - https://what-to-watch-sanich123.vercel.app/

#### I used React, React-Router, Redux(RTK Queries), TypeScript.

The application has three pages: a catalog of movies, a separate movie, a page of favorite movies.

#### The application has the following functionality:

1. There is an authentication here. 
2. If you want to add a movie into your favorite list, you have to be authenticated.
3. When you are authenticated, you are able to add comments.
4. You need to be authenticated to follow the favorites page, if you aren't, you will be redirected to the authentication page.

If you want, you can:

clone this project ('git clone [name of repository]'),
navigate into the project's folder ('cd [folder's name]')
install dependencies ('npm i'),
and run the project with the 'npm run start' script.
